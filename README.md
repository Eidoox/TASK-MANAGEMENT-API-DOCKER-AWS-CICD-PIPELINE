## Task Management API: Scalable, Containerized, and Optimized for AWS Deployment
### This Task Management API provides a scalable solution for managing tasks efficiently. Users can register and sign in with secure authentication using JWT, ensuring each userâ€™s access to their own data. Once authenticated, users can create, update, and delete their tasks, with a Redis cache layer to enable fast retrieval of task data. The API is optimized with an NGINX configuration as a reverse proxy request management. Additionally, the application is fully containerized with Docker for seamless deployment on an AWS EC2 instance, ensuring an efficient and reliable development and production workflow.
